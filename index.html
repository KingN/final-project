        <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In 1546, three brothers of Chiericati family divided the family holdings between them. Two of the brothers became patrons of Palladio: Girolamo Chiericati commissioned Palladio to build the imposing Palazzo Chiericati, in Vicenza, today the Museo Civico, and Giovanni Chiericati commissioned Palladio to build the Villa Chiericati. The villa is located in Vancimuglio in the province of Vicenza. It was probably designed in the late 1540s, and was under construction by 1554. When Giovanni died 1558, the villa was still without a roof or colonnades. In 1574, the property was purchased by Ludovico Porto, who had the villa completed by 1584 by Domenico Groppino, a local architect. 
In the following years the villa has suffered various changes to make it like as it is today.
Now Villa Chiericati is included in the World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto by Unesco.</p>

<h1>Project description</h1>

<p>The project that I developed is based on the plans of the Italian architect Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi in 1781, with few little changes at my leisure, where I found no references or documentation, like the internal stairs, corridors and some  decorations.
Villa Chiericati is characterized by Palladio’s usual tripartite division, but here the deep projecting loggia completely dominates the facade. This is Palladio’s first use of a true temple front proceding from the main body of the house, an element know in classical architecture as a pronaos. The rest of the villa is based on a rectangular plan with two floors built above a semi-basement.</p>

<h3>Hierarchical/Model decomposition</h3>

<p>For implement a 3d model of the villa I’ve decided to divide  it into five hierarchical parts with an bottom-up approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basement with main stairs and base of atrium</li>
<li>First floor with external and internal walls with also the ceiling</li>
<li>Second floor</li>
<li>Roof</li>
<li>Decorations (windows,frames, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>All of these parts was then decomposed in sub-parts that assembled together through translation, rotations and duplications functions.
I also decided to take advantage of the symmetry of the plan to create an half part and build the other half just reverting it.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The project was implemented using Javascript and Plasm framework.</p>
