Two of the brothers became patrons of Palladio: Girolamo Chiericati commissioned Palladio to build the imposing Palazzo Chiericati, in Vicenza, today the Museo Civico, and Giovanni Chiericati commissioned Palladio to build the Villa Chiericati. The villa is located in Vancimuglio in the province of Vicenza. It was probably designed in the late 1540s, and was under construction by 1554. When Giovanni died 1558, the villa was still without a roof or colonnades. In 1574, the property was purchased by Ludovico Porto, who had the villa completed by 1584 by Domenico Groppino, a local architect. \r\nIn the following years the villa has suffered various changes to make it like as it is today.\r\nNow Villa Chiericati is included in the World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto, by Unesco.\r\n\r\n# Project description\r\nThe project that I developed is based on the plans of the Italian architect Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi in 1781, with few little changes at my leisure, where I found no references or documentation, like the internal stairs, corridors and some  decorations.\r\nVilla Chiericati is characterized by Palladio’s usual tripartite division, but here the deep projecting loggia completely dominates the facade. This is Palladio’s first use of a true temple front proceding from the main body of the house, an element know in classical architecture as a pronaos. The rest of the villa is based on a rectangular plan with two floors built above a semi-basement.\r\n\r\n### Hierarchical/Model decomposition\r\nFor implement a 3D model of the villa I have decided to divide it into six hierarchical parts with an bottom-up approach:\r\n\r\n- Basement with main stairs and base of atrium\r\n- First floor with external and internal walls with also the internal stairs \r\n- Second floor\r\n- Atrium\r\n- Roof\r\n- Decorations (windows,frames, etc.)\r\n\r\nAll of these parts was then decomposed in sub-parts that assembled together through translation, rotations and duplications functions.\r\nI also decided to take advantage of the symmetry of the plan to create an half part and build the other half just reverting it.\r\n\r\n###Implementation\r\nThe project was implemented using Javascript and Plasm framework.\r\n\r\n####Basement\r\nThe basement is composed by the villa base, the main stairs, the atrium base and the pavement of the first floor.\r\n--foto \r\nThe villa base has been created using SIMPLEX_GRID function while the pavement, using CUBOID function.\r\nFor the atrium base I used SIMPLEX_GRID and BEZIER curves for atrium base arches. \r\nThe main stairs have been implemented through a function that I have personally developed. At the end, the wall of the main stairs has been created using SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX function.\r\n--foto\r\n\r\n####First Floor\r\nThe first floor is composed by external and internal walls that have been created using SIMPLEX_GRID function.\r\n---foto\r\nI have implemented also a simple internal stair using the alternative version of the above mentioned stairs function.\r\n---foto\r\n\r\n####Second Floor\r\nThe second floor is composed by the superior pavement, internal superior walls and another stair.\r\n---foto\r\nThe walls has been implemented by SIMPLEX_GRID and SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX.\r\n---foto\r\n\r\n####Atrium\r\nThe atrium was one of the hardest parts of the project. It is composed by the atrium arch, the columns and the tympanum. \r\nThe atrium arch is made by BEZIER curves while the tympanum is a mix of CUBOID and SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX.\r\n----foto\r\nThe columns were created using CYL_SURFACE for the shaft, CUBOID for the base and BEZIER for the capital.\r\n---foto\r\n\r\n####Roof\r\nI have decide to divide the roof in three parts(front,side,rear). All the three parts were created using SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX function. \r\n---foto\r\n\r\n","name":"Villa Chiericati Plasm 3D Model"}
